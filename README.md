# Nathanial's Puzzler Project

In this fantastic game The Puzzler you're transported into a mysterious dungeon set in the mountains. The game challenges it's players memory in a simon says sort of way, and only if they succeded do they move on. This game was created to help teach me the importance of documenting my work, and over all the process of making a game from start to finish. It took me 5 hours off and on to get everything set up. The orbs highlight blue, I made them a pink color to complement the blue lighting and blue highlight. The goal was to set a magical and mysterious tone for our users.

Here's a video of gameplay

# The Process

The orbs need to be in direct line of site for it's players so they can see the sequence, and easily repeat it. My original sketches helped me decide on where not to put them. At the begining my dungeon was complicated with stairs and orbs scattered around the room which would make it very difficult for the game to actually be played. Requiring users to look in places that wouldn't be comfortable.

# User Testing

With the first user test I realized that we were little people in the land of Giants. I had my 6 year old son test the game. I asked how big do you think you are? "Six bricks tall" I asked is that very big? "No" he replied. With that, I went in and made us taller, I also brought down the ceilling. After the UI section was completed User testing made clear to me that the instructions were unclear. Lillie, the one seen in the picture was confused on what to actually do in the game. "I don't know what i'm doing". Do you see the orbs lighting up? "Yes" she replied. That prompted me to add in the User Interface Play  "A Memory Game". This way at the start of the game the users would have a vague idea as to what their goal was and what to exepect.

# BreakDown

The player is prompted with a window "Welcome to Puzzler A Memory Game". User testing prompted me to add a clue as to what the game was and what to expect. Ambient noise plays in the back. After the player clicks the play button a rail motion  moves the player into our dungeon where the sound changes, setting a more thrilling tone. their only escape is to repeat the sequence of spheres lighting up. If the user fails a sound indicates that they got it wrong and the game restarts the sequence until the player advances. When the player finishes the game they are congratulated and asked if they'd like to replay. If they choose to click the button it takes them back to the start of the game. Where they will be given a new sequence to solve. 

# Conclusion

Puzzler is a fun and simple game suited for all ages. Taking place in Virtual reality, it transports the user to a dunegon like setting in the snowy mountains. Puzzler puts your memory to the test. Can you finish the puzzle?!
